# üå∂Ô∏è Overview

**Picanteo** is a flexible and modular framework developed by CNES for building custom change detection pipelines. It provides a set of tools in the `picanteo/toolbox` module, allowing users to create tailored pipelines or integrate their own tools to extend functionality.  
Whether you're analyzing satellite imagery or other geospatial data, **Picanteo** simplifies the process of detecting changes in dynamic environments.

# ‚ú® Features
- **Modular Pipeline Design**: Easily construct and customize change detection pipelines using predefined or user-developed tools.
- **Extensible Toolbox**: Integrate your own tools into the `picanteo/toolbox` for enhanced flexibility.
- **Configuration-Driven**: Define pipelines using simple YAML configuration files.
- **Open Source**: Licensed under the Apache 2.0 License, encouraging collaboration and contributions.

# üöÄ Quick Start

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Install **Picanteo** via pip:
```sh
pip install picanteo
```
### Requirements
- Python 3.9 or higher

Dependencies are automatically installed via pip.  
See [install_requires](setup.cfg) for details.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Run **Picanteo**

1) To launch **Picanteo**, you need a YAML configuration file specifying the pipeline and its parameters. 
Template configurations are available in the `/conf/pipelines` directory.  
2) Create or modify a YAML configuration file (e.g., my_conf.yaml).

3) Once this file is created, simply run the following command:
```sh
picanteo my_conf.yaml
```

If you want to try the pipelines already available in **Picanteo**, you have to download the weights from our model with this [link](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1n1olMUY3ycx48YRZ7ZG-ME63cNjnRBtc). Then you have to move those weights in a specific folder:
```sh
mkdir docs/tutorials/data/weights && mv weights.ckpt docs/tutorials/data/weights/manet_cos1_weights.ckpt
```
Then you can run the following command to launch the bitemporal 2D/3D change detection pipeline demo:
```sh
picanteo conf/pipelines/bitemporal_2D3D_pipeline.yaml
```
And you can run the following command to try the bitemporal 2D change detection pipeline demo:
```sh
picanteo conf/pipelines/bitemporal_2D_pipeline.yaml
```
You can now see the results with the following command line:
```sh
picanteo_visualize conf/steps/visualization_conf.yaml
```
*Hint:  in case you just want to try one of the pipelines, you should edit the `visualization_conf.yaml` and remove the unused pipeline under the `pages` section.*
